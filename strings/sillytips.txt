Clerks aren't meant to survive past 40 minutes. If they do - they are to be classified as an abnormality themselves for defying the laws of this place.
We hire clerks as meat shields against abnormalities like Big Bird. Throw a clerk at it and attack the bird while it's chewing their head!
Don't attack the crimson clowns that are operating the abnormality consoles, they are our system administrators performing maintenance check.
